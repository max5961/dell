OBJECTS BIG-O
  insert: O(1) - constant
  remove: O(1) - constant
  access: O(1) - constant
  search: O(n) - linear
  
  Linear time complexity Object static methods:
    Object.keys(): returns an array of all the keys of an object
    Object.values(): returns an array of all the values of an object
    Object.entries(): returns an array of key/value pairs bundled into an array

ARRAYS BIG-O:
  The main difference between objects and arrays is that arrays are ordered, unlike objects
  
  insert/remove at end: O(1) - constant
  insert/remove at beginning: O(n) - linear
    This is because the index has to be reset for every remaining element after removing the element at index 0
  access: O(1) - constant
  search: O(n) - linear
  
  
  Common Array.prototype methods
    push/pop: O(1) - constant
    shift/unshift/concat/slice/splice: O(n) - linear
    forEach/map/filter/reduce: O(n) - linear
